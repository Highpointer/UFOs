# UFOs

#### IMPORTANT NOTE: With the help of AskBCS Learning Assistants, I got the JavaScript and HTML files working as intended. However, the naming conventions may not match the names as exactly stated in the Challenge requirements. I don't want risk renaming files and messing up what is working. 

#### Therefore, the working Javascript file is app2.js, and the working HTML file is index_new.html. If I need to change these names, then please let me know and I will do that, and resubmit.
